Udacity's Android Nanodegree - Project 1: Sandwich Club

![](sandwich_club.gif)

## Project Overview
Display a main list of sandwiches by name.  Selecting a line item
will open a detail activity displaying an image and descriptions
of the sandwich.

## What I Used To Implement This
- Utilize Android's JSON library to receive and parse a JSON
string into a set of key values used to instantiate a list of
Sandwich objects.
- Design and populate the detail activity layout
- Utilize Butterknife for easier view binding
